It eases the burden on data / analytics engineers, eliminates the need for API engineers to create data analytics APIs, and allows data / analytics engineers to play a bigger role in creating backend services for data analytics and tools for AI agent. With a primary focus on reusability and flexibility, Squirrels also allows for query logic to be shared across multiple front-end applications or AI agents. The framework makes it easy to create REST APIs that generate complex SQL queries using authenticated user attributes and selected parameter values, and delivering tabular results that can change behaviour based on the selected values."}),"\n",(0,r.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["For those familiar with ",(0,r.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.getdbt.com/",children:"dbt"}),", Squirrels uses a similar data modelling approach.
