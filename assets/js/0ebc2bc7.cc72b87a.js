It gained popularity largely because of how ubiquitous SQL and Python skills are among data professionals. After creating cleaned/processed tables with dbt, these tables may be queried using tools like Tableau, Looker, PowerBI, Excel, etc. Tableau uses VizQL, Looker uses LookML, PowerBI uses DAX, and Excel uses its own syntax for Excel formulas. This means if an analytics engineer works with dbt and Tableau in one company, and then switched jobs to work with dbt and Looker instead, the engineer would need to learn a new query language for Looker. On the other hand, Squirrels lets you write your dynamic real-time queries with YAML, SQL (templated with Jinja), and sometimes Python, which is similar to dbt!
