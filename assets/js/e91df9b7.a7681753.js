But it often comes down to a few technical data experts to answer the growing number of data questions. For instance, suppose that today, a company executive asks for revenue by location for last year, and then tomorrow, asks for revenue by day of week for the last quarter only. For many organizations, these executives must rely on others to produce the required analytics rather than being able to retrieve the information themselves (for instance, by clicking a button in a graphical user interface).
