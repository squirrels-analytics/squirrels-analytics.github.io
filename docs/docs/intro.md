# Introduction

## What is Squirrels?

Squirrels is a low-code API server framework for building data analytics APIs.

Want to serve well-described datasets to AI agents? Squirrels has you covered! Simply create a Squirrels project with a few data models and parameters. Then, through a built-in MCP server, the framework exposes the tools that AI agents can use to interact with your data dynamically. No need to reinvent the wheel!

## Highlights

- 🚀 **Low-Code REST API Development**: Create data analytics APIs without extensive backend engineering, empowering data engineers to build production-ready services.
- 🤖 **AI-Ready Architecture**: Built-in MCP server for serving dataset metadata and results to AI agents.
- 🔌 **Multi-Database Support**: Connect to multiple databases or data warehouses within a single project and combine data across sources.
- 📊 **Flexible Data Modeling**: Write data models that can reference other data models using Jinja-templated SQL or Python.
- ⚙️ **Interactive Parameters**: Create dynamic datasets and dashboards that respond to user inputs and selections.
- 🔒 **Built-in Security**: Complete user management system with access controls, authentication, and dataset permissions.
- 💻 **Simple Developer Experience**: Quick setup with CLI commands `pip install squirrels` and `sqrl new`.
